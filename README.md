# Folder Structure

Keep this structure:

```txt
ZEN MENU/
├─ main.py
├─ config.json
├─ requirements.txt
├─ install_requirements.bat
├─ build_exe.bat
├─ README.md
├─ README.txt
├─ CHANGELOG.md
├─ assets/
│  ├─ banners/
│  │  ├─ zen_banner.png
│  │  └─ discord_banner.png
│  ├─ icons/
│  │  └─ app.ico
│  ├─ images/
│  │  └─ zen.png
│  └─ sounds/
│     ├─ startup.wav
│     ├─ click.wav
│     ├─ success.wav
│     ├─ error.wav
│     └─ notification.wav
├─ modules/
├─ plugins/
├─ config_profiles/
├─ update_backups/
└─ crash_logs/
```

When you build the `.exe`, keep this next to the executable:

```txt
dist/
├─ ZEN MENU.exe
├─ config.json
├─ assets/
├─ plugins/
├─ README.txt
└─ CHANGELOG.md
```

If `assets/`, `plugins/` or `config.json` are missing beside the `.exe`, some features may not work.

Lyrics Sync
```

You need a Spotify Developer app.

Use redirect URI:

```txt
http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
```

Put credentials in `config.json`:

```json
"spotify": {
  "enabled": true,
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "redirect_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback",
  "show_lyrics": true
}
```

Do not upload your real Spotify secret to GitHub.

---

# Discord Rich Presence Setup

You need a Discord Application ID.

Put it in `config.json`:

```json
"discord": {
  "enabled": true,
  "client_id": "YOUR_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID"
}
```

Discord desktop app must be open.

---

# Safe Mode

Open ZEN MENU in Safe Mode:

```bat
python main.py --safe
```

Or:

```bat
ZEN MENU.exe --safe
```

Safe Mode is useful if something breaks.

---

# Troubleshooting

## Python is not recognized

Reinstall Python and enable:

```txt
Add Python to PATH
```

Test:

```bat
python --version
```

---

## pip install fails

Run:

```bat
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## FFmpeg not found

Test:

```bat
ffmpeg -version
```

If it fails, add this to PATH:

```txt
C:\ffmpeg\bin
```

Then open a new CMD.

---

## Ollama not working

Test:

```bat
ollama list
```

If it fails, open Ollama or reinstall it.

Then run:

```bat
ollama pull llama3.1
```

---

## Soundboard does not play through microphone

Install VB-CABLE and configure:

```txt
Windows Output: CABLE Input
Discord Input: CABLE Output
```

Then play sounds in ZEN MENU.

---

## Theme does not change

Save the theme and restart the app.

---

## Startup sound does not play

Check if this file exists:

```txt
assets/sounds/startup.wav
```

Also check:

```json
"ui_sounds": true
```

---

## EXE opens but assets are missing

Keep this next to the `.exe`:

```txt
assets/
config.json
plugins/
```

---

## Plugin does not appear

Check if the folder has:

```txt
plugin.json
main.py
```

Then restart the app or reload plugins.

---

## App crashes immediately

Run from CMD:

```bat
python main.py
```

This shows the real error.

You can also try:

```bat
python main.py --safe
```

---
